        <p>
          After <a href="germany-italy.html">Italy</a>, the next big
          international trip we’d been saving for was China. We planned it all
          out, booked our hotels, flights, trains, everything. Or so we thought.
          When we showed up at the airport to catch our flight, we were
          heartbroken to discover that we needed visas, which we didn’t have. We
          spent a little time trying to figure out how we might get them
          quickly, but realized pretty fast that it wasn’t going to happen. So
          we put our heads together to come up with a plan B, since Ana already
          had the time off work. We talked about a lot of different places, but
          when she suggested Iceland, I jumped on it. I’d wanted to go for a
          while, but we hadn’t prioritized it. Within fourteen hours of our
          China failure, we had plane tickets and accommodations booked for
          Iceland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting there was a bit of a trial. Because we booked our flights just
          days before traveling, we got some crazy connections. We made it to
          Atlanta, but missed our connection to Minneapolis because of
          mechanical problems. That meant we missed our connection in
          Minneapolis to Iceland. So we rebooked to go through New York instead.
          We spent the night in Atlanta and headed to New York the next day. We
          left New York on time and were getting excited about being in Iceland,
          when the pilot came on and said that there was fog in all of Iceland
          and we didn’t have enough fuel to circle and wait for the fog to
          clear. We were halfway across the Atlantic, so they turned around and
          headed back to a military base in Goose Bay, Canada. Because the base
          didn’t have customs, we all had to stay on the plane. And our crew
          also hit their shift-time limit, so they had to send for a new crew
          from Minneapolis. We spent eight hours sitting in the plane on the
          runway in Canada (with one small, controlled visit to a bathroom
          nearby), but people were mostly in good spirits. We finally made it to
          Iceland a few days late, but the places we were staying were able to
          shift our dates and the airline extended our return date, so we didn’t
          miss any time in the home of the Vikings.
        </p>
        <p>
          And once we stepped out of the airport, it was clear that our arduous
          journey was all worth it. Iceland is by far the most magical place
          I’ve ever been. Most of the places we’d traveled to were largely full
          of human-made wonders. But Iceland has natural beauty. It’s one of the
          newer pieces of land where people live. The island is the product of
          volcanic activity pushing up from the bottom of the ocean. It also
          sits on the boundary between two tectonic plates. All this means there
          are faults and volcanoes throughout the island. But it’s also very far
          north, which means sometimes there are glaciers sitting on top of the
          volcanoes. And there are fjords and waterfalls and hot, earthy gases
          steaming up from the depths. Lush green fields, gorgeous lavender
          lupines, and beaches of black sand. You have to see it to believe it.

          The population of the whole country is about 330,000, which is fewer
          people than live in New Orleans. While we were there about 10% of the
          country was in France for the Eurocup soccer championship, which
          Iceland did well in (note the photo above of a midnight street party
          after a win). Their capital city, Reykjavik, has 110,000 people. Their
          Parliament building is the smallest I’ve ever seen. Everyone speaks
          English, partly because they know it would just be too much to expect
          people to speak Icelandic. Their most famous volcano is
          Eyjafjallajökull. So many people pronounced it for me and I have a
          good ear for languages, but I could never get it. But it just rolls
          off their tongues.

          There isn’t much public transportation in Iceland. So we did what all
          Icelanders do; we drove. We rented a car and spent the first part of
          our trip on the northeastern part of the island in Akureyri (also
          never really got the pronunciation right). The red lights were all in
          the shape of a heart.

          We took a few day trips from our base there to see what looked like a
          gassy martian landscape, some awesome waterfalls, a fjord, and a
          snow-capped mountain. Plus, lots of sheep and horses, which the
          Icelanders raise to eat. I can’t tell you how many times we pulled
          over to take pictures every time a new view took our breath away.
        </p>
        <p>
          We spent the last half of our trip just outside Reykjavik on a little
          farm. We explored the city, including the amazing concert hall and
          some cool museums. We also did a few day trips to see puffins, more
          beautiful waterfalls, and a place where you can see where the tectonic
          plates meet. We also spelunked in a lava tube and Ana ate as many
          Icelandic hot dogs as she could. One of my favorite things was that,
          because we were there near the summer solstice, it never really got
          dark. The sun would dip below the horizon for a little bit around
          midnight, but you could always see. I found this exhilarating, but Ana
          found it a bit disorienting. I loved not having a schedule dictated by
          a clock. It was strange roaming the streets of Reykjavik at midnight
          with drunken bar hoppers without the cover of night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can’t wait until we can go back. There are lots of parts of Iceland
          we still need to explore. Next time, I think we might get a camper van
          so we can just sleep as we go.
