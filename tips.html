              >2014</a

            home.

          The more you travel, the better at it you get. We’ve definitely
          learned a lot from each trip and, as a result, our trips run more
          smoothly each time we hit the road. Here are some of the things we’ve
          learned, so you can avoid making these mistakes on your next trip.

            <a id="pack-light"><strong>Pack light.</strong></a> For our trip to
            Southeast Asia in 2007, we both bought huge backpacks with frames.
            They were both pretty packed when we first arrived. Ana prioritizes
            looking cute, which for her meant bringing a lot of options. Every
            time we relocated (which happened three or four times, I think), we
            had a lot to carry. This was particularly hard on Ana. And we didn’t
            anticipate all the gifts we wanted to buy, which we had to carry
            everywhere we went. It was a lot. We’ve since bought smaller
            backpacks and on our last trip, Ana opted for a small, rolling
            suitcase instead of her backpack. (She also balances practicality
            and style better now.) Someday, maybe we’ll even be able to get
            everything into one backpack for both of us. I usually bring about
            six days worth of clothes and then do laundry every five days or so.
            This means doing laundry once for a 10-day trip and about six times
            for a five week trip. I like finding laundromats and doing my
            laundry in different countries, because it feels like an authentic
            local experience that isn’t made for tourists. You get to see a side
            of the country you might not otherwise see. And you might meet
            people that way too.

            <a id="have-a-plan"><strong>Have a plan.</strong></a> We’ve had
            detailed, carefully timed plans on some of our trips and rougher
            plans on others. But we always have a plan. That means doing our
            research ahead of time, using a combination of web searches, buying
            travel books, and talking to people we know who’ve been where we’re
            going. When it comes to web searches, one of our favorite sites is
            Atlas Obscura. It is a wealth of oddities. We’ve found some of the
            best places we’ve ever seen on
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/"
              >Atlas Obscura</a
            >. When it comes to books, our favorite books are written by
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/guidebooks"
              >Rick Steves</a
            >. Unfortunately, he doesn’t have a guide for every country, but if
            he does, it’ll be well worth the money. His book about Italy saved
            us a lot of time and money. When you’re planning, prioritize what
            you want to see, but be aware of second choices that are nearby.
            Sometimes you’ll go somewhere you thought would be great and it
            turns out to be way overrated. Having back-up sites nearby is good
            planning.

            <a id="pace-yourself"><strong>Pace yourself.</strong></a> When you
            start looking into all the amazing things you could see and do in a
            place, you’ll want to do way more than you’ll have time to do. Be
            realistic about how long things will take. For instance, if you’re
            going to St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, go first thing in the morning
            (to beat the crowds) and block off the whole morning. You might
            think, it’s just a church, how long can it take to see a church? The
            truth is you could spend a day in a place like this. Give yourself
            time to really see everything. Be in a place long enough for the
            feeling of it to wash over you. Soak it all in. Also, be sure to
            build in time for meals, even if you’re packing a lunch or dinner in
            your day bag. It’s important to stop, sit, rest, and reflect
            periodically. You might have the energy to push yourself for the
            first few days, but at some point that will catch up with you and
            you’ll find yourself in a hotel in a faraway place.

            <a id="walk"><strong>Walk.</strong></a> Most trips will involve a
            lot of mechanized travel: planes, boats, cars, tuk-tuks, etc. Use
            them when you must (like in transit to or from the airport), but
            don’t over-rely on them. Walk as much as you can. If you’re heading
            for the subway to go two stops, walking will often take not much
            longer. And you see things when you walk that you will never see
            from a vehicle. You can observe people, notice out-of-the-way
            passages and places, and stumble on great finds. In Munich once, we
            were walking down a street and noticed a cathedral. We walked in and
            it was one of the most amazing Baroque cathedrals either of us had
            ever seen. We walk a lot on our trips. In Prague, we walked an
            average of six miles a day. We definitely could have gotten around
            on buses or the metro (subway), which we did some, when the
            distances were far. But we loved walking through neighborhoods,
            seeing playgrounds and schools, apartment buildings, local shops.
            The exercise is also good for you; it helps keep your head clear and
            gives you a chance to talk to the people you’re traveling with. Hoof
            it as much as you can.
