    <h2>"London"</h2>

    <p>
Now as he sits<br/>
In the back of the grey caravan<br/>
Tomorrow he'll probably be<br/>
Jumping Parisian metro barriers<br/>
With a bottle in his hands<br/>
Sparkling, sparkling water mixed with peaches and rum<br/>
"Honestly I don't drink<br/>
But if I did this would be my favourite punch"<br/>
He said
    </p>
    <p>
Walk out the door with her<br/>
He could see everyone dressed in black<br/>
A class that seem too far, too fetched<br/>
She said look at you, look at you, the game is over<br/>
Your cup is full, your cup is full<br/>
Stop praying for more exposure<br/>
It is obvious that you are trying<br/>
Dubious, stop or you die here<br/>
You're pretending but no one is buying
    </p>
    <p>
London, London, London is calling you<br/>
What are you waiting for?<br/>
What you searching for?<br/>
London, London, London is all in you<br/>
Why are you denying the truth?<br/>
"I might, I might, I might be boring you" he said<br/>
Although it's not clear as the morning dew<br/>
Though my preferred ways are not happening<br/>
I won't underestimate who I am capable of becoming
    </p>
    <p>
History will be made today<br/>
Is written boldly on his face<br/>
So clear you could hardly miss it<br/>
You could hardly miss it<br/>
For transcending the barriers<br/>
Of yesterday was and is the dream<br/>
On a road where Cleopatra comes and goes<br/>
Like fishes caught in ponds<br/>
Then thrown back for fun
    </p>
    <p>
She said, "Look at you, look at you, just pick a fleet"<br/>
Your cup is full, your cup is full<br/>
What have you not yet achieved?<br/>
It is obvious that you are trying<br/>
Dubious, stop or you die here<br/>
You're pretending but no one is buying
    </p>
    <p>
London, London, London is calling you<br/>
What are you waiting for?<br/>
What you searching for?<br/>
London, London, London is all in you<br/>
Why are you denying the truth?<br/>
"I might, I might, I might be boring you" he said<br/>
Although it's not clear as the morning dew<br/>
Though my preferred ways are not happening<br/>
I won't underestimate<br/>
Who I am capable of becoming
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Shout</h2>
    <h3>by <a href="https://www.thewho.com/pete-townshend/">Pete Townshend</a></h3>
    <p>
Oh, oh<br/>
Oh, oh<br/>
I miss you, I miss you<br/>
I remember lying by your side<br/>
Up in the eerie waters of paradise<br/>
N' then one day you walked out<br/>
Now I have nothing to do but shout
    </p>
    <p>
And I want my voice<br/>
To cut over mountains<br/>
And I want my soul<br/>
To gush up like fountains<br/>
To where you reside
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Creature/3rd Chair</h2>
    <h3>by <a href="https://www.hihowareyou.com/">Daniel Johnston</a></h3>
    <p>
Love is priceless<br/>
And I'm still paying the bill<br/>
I get to loving you so much<br/>
It just ain't right sometimes<br/>
The creature's panting through his gill<br/>
Can't you see the pleading in his eyes?<br/>
It says "If you want me to, I will"<br/>
Just don't ask him why<br/>
She was my girl<br/>
But now she's gone
    </p>
