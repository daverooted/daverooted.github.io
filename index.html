          Ana is my amazing girlfriend. I feel super lucky that we've been
          together since 1999. One of the things we love to do most is travel.
          We've been lots of places. We try to take a trip every year, even if
          it's just a road trip. Here are some of the places we've traveled:

          I’ve loved to travel for as long as I can remember. It’s not just
          being someplace different, though I love that part of it. It’s also
          the journey. I’ve always been drawn to airports and the buzzing energy
          that exudes from so many travelers being in one place at a time. I
          also really enjoy flying. It’s almost a spiritual experience to be
          lifted up into the clouds, even when the ride is a little bumpy. I
          haven’t really traveled by boat for long distances, but I love being
          on the water. And put me in a train any day.

          I’m not sure why it took so long for us to make traveling a regular
          part of our lives together, but Ana and I didn’t really go on a trip
          together until November 2006 (the trip to Germany in 2002 was for my
          brother's wedding). Perhaps it was because Ana was in school for
          nearly the first six years of our relationship and I was the only one
          earning an income. We love to travel—especially together. I’m so glad
          we’ve made a commitment to make it focus of our relationship.

          Of course we’ve visited family, but that isn’t the same as traveling
          for pleasure. I like to make a distinction between a visit and a trip.
          Sometimes the two overlap, but we find a way to explore where we are
          enough to call it (at least partly) a trip. But some places (like
          where my mother lives in Illinois or where Ana’s grandmother used to
          live in Florida) just aren’t that interesting, so we end up spending
          all our time with friends or family.

          I’m looking forward to reflecting a bit on where we’ve been. We have a
          lot of dreams about where we’d still like to go. Until then, looking
          back will have to suffice.
