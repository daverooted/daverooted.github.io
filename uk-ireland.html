            Ana started travelling with books (paper or electronic) on this
            trip, because I sometimes get caught up taking a lot of photos. Here
            she is atop Edinburgh Castle in the summer of 2011.

          My mother wanted to do something nice for Ana and me. She had some
          Marriott points saved up and offered them to us. We started looking
          around and decided to stay a week in London. We figured we could
          afford another week, which we opted to split between Scotland and
          Ireland. The Marriott we chose was in Twickenham, about 30 minutes out
          of the center of London and actually located inside a rugby stadium.
          We loved taking the train into and back out of town every day. It gave
          us time to plan in the morning and reflect in the afternoon.

          I had been to London before, but Ana had not. She immediately fell in
          love. It’s a pretty great city. Lots of old buildings right next to
          new, modern ones, partly because the city was so heavily bombed during
          World War II. Again, we did lots of walking. It’s really the best way
          to explore, no matter what continent you’re on. We saw the Rosetta
          Stone in the British Museum—along with lots of other stolen art from
          all over the world. We took a boat ride down the Thames to Greenwich,
          so we could stand with one foot in the western hemisphere and one foot
          in the eastern hemisphere. Another example of British colonial
          arrogance. I’m really selling London, aren’t I? We saw an awesome
          Doctor Who exhibit, visited some of my friends from Prague, and did a
          little shopping on the high street. Of course we ate a lot of
          delicious Indian food, my favorite kind of food to eat in Britain. We
          even had two free tours—one near Parliament from a guy who was
          practicing giving tours and another that taught us about one of the
          plagues that London faced several hundred years ago. We were lucky,
          too, that the weather was mostly good.

          After a week in Londontown, we caught a quick flight up to Edinburgh,
          Scotland. We took a few days to explore the city, the castle, and the
          countryside. We found a place that served vegan haggis, which was
          delicious. Ana tried the real thing and was put off by it, though I’m
          not sure if it was the taste or the idea of it. She has a pretty vivid
          imagination and knew it was made of sheep’s stomach. Edinburgh was
          lovely. Thistles and plaid tartans everywhere. We definitely plan to
          go back and see more of the country. Maybe next time we go, they’ll be
          a separate country. They’ve been a part of Great Britain since 1707.
          But they do already have their own Parliament, which meets in a lovely
          building we visited.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few days in one gaelic land, we caught a quick flight over to
          Dublin, in the heart of another gaelic country, which we called
          Ireland and they call Eire. Unlike in Scotland, where their gaelic is
          largely incidental, all the signs in Ireland are bilingual. Also all
          the subway announcements are made in both languages. We explored
          Dublin a bit and then caught a train out to Kilkenny for a few days in
          the countryside. We checked out the castle there, hung out in the pub
          downstairs from our hostel, and shopped for souvenirs. And as in
          Scotland and England, we took advantage of the fact that we were in an
          English-speaking country and had some great conversations with locals.

          We popped back to London for a night before heading home, knowing we’d
          be back some day.
