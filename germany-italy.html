          The other five-week trip we took was to Germany and Italy. We spent
          the first week in Germany with my brother and his family. They live in
          Nuremberg. We arranged for my mother to be there at the same time as
          we were there. A lot of what we did was things the kids would like,
          but we did spend a little time exploring the city, including the
          castle. It’s a pretty city with a complicated history. It was once the
          seat of the Holy Roman Empire. It was also Hitler’s favorite city.
          Germany has done a lot of work to ensure that someone like Hitler
          wouldn’t be able to again rise to power with so much popular support.
          Thanks in part to conditions of their surrender in 1945, they are
          today one of the most stable, prosperous countries in Europe. We will
          definitely be back to visit again, because we have family there. We
          always hope to catch a few more sights when we go.
        </p>

          After our week-long visit with family, we caught a sleeper train to
          Italy and woke up in one of my favorite cities in the world, Venice.
          It had been more than twenty years since I’d been, but it still looked
          exactly the same. I’m sure it will, until it sinks into the sea. My
          favorite cathedral in Europe is there: St. Mark’s. And as someone who
          loves to walk, Venice is a treat. Because of the canals, there are no
          cars or even bicycles. You get around on foot or by boat. It’s the
          best place to get lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Venice, we headed down to Florence, which we used as our base of
          operations for about eight days. We of course took in the sights in
          Florence itself, like the Uffizi, Michelangelo’s David, the Ponte
          Vecchio, and one of many incredible anatomical museums we visited. We
          took jaunts from Florence to Siena, Bologna, Pisa, and Cinque Terre,
          one of the idyllic places I’ve ever been. We wished we’d had more time
          in Pisa, but we can always go back.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Florence, we headed down to Naples, a city I’d never visited. We
          both loved it. I think it was Ana’s favorite. It somehow seemed more
          real, not overrun with so many non-Italian tourists. We spent a day on
          the island of Capri, which was slightly marred by Ana’s seasickness
          getting there. I rode a chair lift to the top of the island for an
          amazing view of the Mediterranean. And, like every other day we were
          in Italy, we ate lots of yummy gelato and sorbetto! Back in Naples, we
          hopped over to Pompeii for a day in the ruins under the shadow of
          Mount Vesuvius.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Naples, we headed to Rome for our last week or so. We also
          springboarded a few day trips out of Rome, including one to Assisi and
          one to Ostia Antica. But we spent most of our time in the city—there’s
          just too much to see in a city with as much history as it has (are
          there cities with as much history as Rome?). We spent a day in the
          Vatican Museum. Wow. And we popped into so many cathedrals, including
          St. Peter’s and St. Paul’s. Really, you could spend an entire trip to
          Italy just visiting cathedrals and you would see more amazing art for
          free than you could imagine. In fact, some of the most famous works of
          Italian art can only be seen that way. We also visited the Forum and
          the Colosseum, as well as the Pantheon and some early Christian
          catacombs. And did I mention the delicious Italian food? We bought so
          many gifts for people that we had to buy an extra suitcase just to get
          it all home! We hope this was just our first trip to Italy.
