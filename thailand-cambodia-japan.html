          Neither of us had ever been to Asia before. A friend from my childhood
          was living just outside Bangkok, Thailand, and he offered to put us up
          and show us around. It was an offer we couldn’t refuse. Ana saved up
          all of her vacation time, so we could take a five-week trip. I was
          self-employed, so it wasn’t as hard for me to get time off. Plus I was
          already preparing to transition from programming to teaching, so I was
          winding down my tech work.

          We decided to spend four weeks in Southeast Asia with Ted and his
          girlfriend Rachel and one week in Japan, on our way back home (since
          our flights were already connecting in Tokyo). Our journey there took
          three flights: New Orleans to Chicago (two hours), Chicago to Tokyo
          (eighteen hours), and Tokyo to Bangkok (seven hours). It’s still the
          longest journey we’ve ever taken, but it was so worth it.

          Thailand is beautiful. Unlike all the countries all around it, it was
          never colonized by Europeans. So its culture is largely intact. We
          both love Thai food and I loved eating fresh, delicious cooking every
          day. Ana gets tired of the same thing every day, even when it’s food
          she likes, so a few times we hunted down a restaurant that would make
          her some spaghetti. We went into Bangkok on our own several times and
          spent a lot of time walking. That was our first experience with a
          bustling Asian metropolis. And with the power of Buddhist monks! We
          also took a trip on our own to Sukhothai, which was magical. Ted and
          Rachel also showed us around a lot, taking us to a beautiful national
          park with a monsoonal forest and a hilarious cave tour. We even went
          to a vineyard. Towards the end of our stay we spent a few days on Ko
          Samui, an large island in the Gulf of Thailand. There we saw some of
          the most beautiful temples we’d seen on our whole trip.

          Ted proposed spending a week outside of Thailand. We talked about
          going to Nepal, Vietnam, or Myanmar, but we ultimately settled on
          Cambodia, right next door. Ted and Rachel joined us in Angkor to look
          at the beautiful, overgrown ruins of some ancient temples. We hired a
          guide who drove us around and gave us time to explore at about five or
          six different temples in the course of a few days. Then, Rachel and
          Ted headed back to Bangkok. Ana and I took a boat down the Tonle Sap
          to Phnom Penh, the capital. We spent a few days taking in a very
          different part of Cambodia. The scars of the Khmer Rouge regime were
          still apparent there. We visited the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek, and
          the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, housed in a former high school that
          was turned into a torture facility and prison during the reign of Pol
          Pot, a former math teacher. We came face to face with desperate
          poverty in ways we never did in Thailand or Japan. Sometimes traveling
          can be exhilarating and sometimes it punches you in the gut. Sometimes
          the two are separated by a short boat ride.

          After four weeks, we said goodbye to Ted and Rachel and other new
          friends we’d met. We headed to Tokyo for the last week of our trip. We
          had sweated through our clothes every day in Thailand and Cambodia. It
          was like New Orleans in August, but it was March and April. Japan,
          however, was a different story. It’s so much further north. The
          weather was cool and crisp. We were lucky enough to catch the tail end
          of the short window when the cherry trees blossom. So much pink, so
          much joy! We spent a lot of time walking around Tokyo, which was
          great. We also spent a lot of time on the subway, because Tokyo is
          huge. I spent several hours one morning learning how addresses work,
          so we could find places we wanted to go. Let’s just say it’s the crazy
          system I’ve ever seen. We visited Harajuku to see the cosplayers,
          walked by the palace, at some yummy sushi, went to the top of the
          Tokyo Tower (such a view!), visited a bunch of museums, and saw the
          busiest intersection crossing in the world in Shibuya. Our trip to
          Japan was too short. I hope we can go back and see more in the future.
